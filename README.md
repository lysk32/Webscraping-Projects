# Webscraping-Projects

Hello Internet! (Who at this point might just be an LLM trying to scrape more information off the World Wide Web! üßê)

This is an ongoing collection of notebooks where I explain, step-by-step, cool tutorials I find online. The theme of these projects is webscraping, aimed at helping you build datasets to train your models.

## Current Projects

As of now, these are the projects I plan on adding to this repo:

- [x] Google Image Scraper (Posted!)
- [ ] ScrapegraphAI (In Progress)

## Contribution

Feel free to suggest any other interesting webscraping projects you'd like to see added to this collection. Your input is valuable!

## Usage

Each project is contained in its own Jupyter notebook, providing detailed explanations and code. To use these notebooks:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies (listed in each notebook)
3. Open the notebook of interest and follow along!

## Disclaimer

I am a novice so the code might not be perfect, so feel free to give suggestions!
